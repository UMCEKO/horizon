//! Mod goals on mobs (arismoko/horizon#1077): the parts a mod attaches to an
//! entity type register their goals at every `Mob` construction, right after
//! the species' own, and the engine wraps each in a [`ModGoal`] that gives the
//! mod its own mob, the tick's read view, its random and its writes.
//!
//! The read view answers through the generated `Backend` impl at the bottom:
//! the ticking mob itself, the player the tick sees and the tick's snapshot of
//! the other entities; entity data the snapshot does not carry is refused its
//! typed refusal, and every other backend read forwards to the real backend of
//! the game host behind the tick. The engine's own goals are
//! untouched, and a mob whose type no mod attached a part to pays nothing.
