//! Command argument types a mod registers (`Registrar::register_command_argument`): parsing and

//!
//! A client that does not know the type still parses the command: the wire tree sends the
//! argument as a Brigadier string (one word, or the rest of the line) and asks the server for its
//! completions. Fabric instead registers the type in the command-argument registry, whose id an
//! unmodded client cannot read and whose node it drops; the string keeps a vanilla tree valid.
