    /// shot by `owner` (a mob's or a player's entity id, 0 for none) in the level
    /// `dimension`. It hit the entity `entity` of type `entity_kind` (a player is

    /// `entity` None, the block at `block` on its `face` (the face's normal,

    /// does not happen: no damage, no knockback, no sound, no block reaction, the
    /// arrow does not stick, a pearl does not teleport, a potion or a fireball
    /// does not burst. The projectile flies on and is not discarded, so a mod
    /// that cancels also decides what becomes of it. It continues through its
    /// whole motion and may hit something on a later tick. Covers what
    /// `tick_projectiles` flies: arrows, tridents, snowballs,
    /// eggs, pearls, potions, fireballs, wither skulls, wind charges, llama spit and
    /// shulker bullets, from players, mobs and dispensers. It does not fire for
    /// a breeze's deflection, for a hit on a wind charge, for fireworks or for
    /// fishing bobbers. A dragon part or End crystal is told by the id of the
    /// dragon or crystal. Heard only when a mod also sets
    /// `native_hears_projectile_impacts`. Server-side.
