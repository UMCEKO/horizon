    /// A block broke or a mob died, and `drops` are the items about to drop, in
    /// the order they drop: what the loot tables rolled (after
    /// `native_loot_table_load`'s changes), and for a mob what it wore, held or
    /// carried (a fox's mouth item, an allay's, piglin's or horse's inventory),
    /// but not an enderman's carried block or a copper golem's preserved
    /// equipment, which drop after. A charged creeper's head and a fox's mouth
    /// item come before the mob's own table. A block's stacks get its block
    /// entity's data (a shulker box's items) after this. Add, change or take out
    /// stacks; empty ones don't drop (NeoForge's global loot modifiers, Fabric's
    /// `LootTableEvents.MODIFY_DROPS`); `context` says what dropped them and
    /// how, and it is called even when `drops` is empty. A player's use drops
    /// through it too (`LootDrops::used`: shears, a brush, an item
    /// frame), with that player named. Lead drops from untying or cutting a
    /// leash, and from a mob a player killed while leashed, pass through here
    /// too, with that player named. It hears blocks that a
    /// player, an explosion or a mob breaks, not other breaks (leaves decaying,
    /// a torch losing its wall, a piston, `/setblock ... destroy`), nor a
    /// creative break or a tool that can't harvest the block, nor experience.
    /// Server-side, for every player.
