//! The `mob_despawn` hook: declaration the mod API generator reads (see `hooks/mod.rs`).

pub trait Hooks {
    /// NeoForge's `MobDespawnEvent`: the mob `mob` (of type `kind`, at `pos`, given as data because a mob taken out for its tick does not resolve through its handle yet) is about to run `Mob.checkDespawn`, which fires once per tick for every mob that is ticked or only checked for despawning, persistent ones and peaceful-mode ones included. Set `result`: `Allow` discards the mob now, `Deny` keeps it this tick, and `Default` (the starting value) leaves vanilla's rules to decide. Anything but `Default` skips vanilla's checks, including the `nextInt(800)` draw of the idle-despawn roll, so the hook fires before that draw: a mob a mod denies does not consume it. A listener is a pure function of its inputs, because the hook fires on replayed ticks. The wither and the ender dragon override `checkDespawn` without `super`, so the event is not fired for them. Server-side. Tick-time effect: one `listened` branch per mob per tick with no listeners.
    #[notes = r#"## Mob despawn

- **`mob_despawn(dimension, mob, kind, pos, result)`** (NeoForge's `MobDespawnEvent`, server): fired once per tick for every loaded mob just before `Mob.checkDespawn`, including persistent mobs and mobs in peaceful. `result` starts as `Despawn::Default`. `Allow` discards the mob now, `Deny` keeps it this tick (a mod can keep a hostile mob in peaceful, as NeoForge's event documents), and `Default` leaves vanilla's rules to decide. An answer other than `Default` skips vanilla's checks, so it also skips the `nextInt(800)` draw of the idle-despawn roll: the hook fires before that draw. A mob whose chunk is not loaded is not checked and the hook does not fire for it; the wither and the ender dragon override `checkDespawn` without `super`, so it does not fire for them either. In vanilla the whole of `Mob.checkDespawn` follows the event, the peaceful-mode discard included, so a `Deny` keeps a hostile mob in peaceful.
- Listeners run on replayed ticks, so they are pure functions of their inputs. Tick-time effect: one `listened` branch per mob per tick with no listeners; the answer sits in a `Mob` field that costs one byte and is reset after the mob's tick.
- Beyond NeoForge: none. `Despawn` is plain data, `#[non_exhaustive]`."#]
