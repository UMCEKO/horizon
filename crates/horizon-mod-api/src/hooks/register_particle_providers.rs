    #[notes = r#"## Particle providers

A particle provider (NeoForge's `RegisterParticleProvidersEvent` and `ParticleProvider`) gives a mod's own
particle type code. `Hooks::register_particle_providers` registers one provider per type name once at start,
before resources load, and the game resolves each type's provider when the particle sprite sets load, so a
particle tick dispatches to the provider that owns it: no lookup, no scan over the mods.

```rust,ignore
struct Orbit;
impl ParticleProvider for Orbit {
    fn tick(&self, particle: &mut ModParticle) {
        let t = f64::from(particle.age) * 0.4;
        particle.position = [
            particle.state[0] + t.cos(),
            particle.state[1] + f64::from(particle.age) * 0.05,
            particle.state[2] + t.sin(),
        ];
        particle.rgba[3] = 1.0 - particle.age as f32 / particle.lifetime as f32;
        if particle.age > 40 {
            particle.removed = true;
        }
    }
}

fn register_particle_providers(
    &self,
    _context: &RegistrationContext,
    event: &mut RegisterParticleProvidersEvent<'_>,
) {
    event.providers.register("example:orbit".into(), Arc::new(Orbit));
}
```

The particle is built as a declarative one is: `ParticleOptions::named("example:orbit")` draws the sprite set
of `assets/example/particles/orbit.json`, with the spawn values of its `horizon:behaviour` (lifetime, size, alpha,
velocity). The engine keeps the sprite handling and the camera-distance, Particles-setting and population limits;
only the motion is the provider's. Before each `tick` the game advances `age` (1 on the first tick) and sets
`previous`, and it expires the particle once `age` passes `lifetime`, or after a tick that sets `removed` or
leaves a number that is not finite. The particle draws on the blended layer, so `rgba[3]` may fade it.
`position`, `frame` (a sprite of the set, clamped), `size`, `rgba`, `lifetime` and `removed` are the tick's to
write. `state` is four numbers that stay with the particle, zero at spawn; it is the only per-particle data,
since every particle of a type shares the one provider (the same for native and wasm mods: a wasm tick is one
call with the particle copied in and out). A tick has no `Host` and no level, since the engine ticks particles
below gameplay; a provider that needs the world reads it in a hook. A type with no provider keeps its
declarative motion, and live provider particles are dropped when resources reload, as a compiled
controller's are."#]
