    /// A player right clicks a block (NeoForge's
    /// `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickBlock`): once per hand, where
    /// `useItemOn` starts, on the clicking client and on the server (`click`
    /// says which, with the block, the hit, the hand and its stack, and the
    /// player). Before the block's own use (a chest, a door, a lever) and the
    /// item's (`Item.useOn`, `native_use_on`).
    ///
    /// `use_block` forces the block's use off (`False`) or on even while
    /// sneaking with something in hand (`True`); `use_item` forces the
    /// item's `useOn` off, or on even while the item cools down. Cancelling
    /// skips both and answers `cancellation_result` in their place:
    /// `Pass` (the default) goes on to the item's own use (`Item.use`) and
    /// then the other hand, `Fail` ends the click, and `Success`,
    /// `SuccessServer` or `Consume` end it as used, with the swing they name.
    /// A mod that keeps players out of land cancels with `Fail`.
