"""Run every library test, ignored or not, with the prepared vanilla data, against a list of known failures.

Usage: ignored_tests.py SHARD...  (HORIZON_TEST_RESOURCES points at the prepared 26.3 data)

A SHARD is a package, or one leg of it written `PACKAGE#NofM` (tools/ci/ignored_shards.py splits the biggest
package so one process does not hold every test's memory). A leg runs the tests whose name hashes to its
number, so every test runs in exactly one leg, and only judges the list's entries for those same tests.
An unqualified horizon-client-lib runs two such selections consecutively on the same runner, releasing
retained fixture memory between processes without adding a matrix job.

Each package's library tests run with `--include-ignored`: the #[ignore]d ones that need the data, and the
ones that return early without it, which `verify` (no data) passes without checking anything. The packages
in INTEGRATION_TESTS also run their `tests/` integration tests. The job fails when a test fails that
tools/ci/ignored-tests-known-failures.txt doesn't list, when a listed test passes (take it off the
list: the list only shrinks), and when a listed test no longer exists. A test marked `flaky` there
may pass or fail; one marked `harness` is a parity harness's step, run by its harness with the
environment it sets, and is skipped here; one marked `gpu` needs a graphics adapter and runs only where
the runner has a Vulkan driver (an ICD file), and must pass there.

Only test names, results, panic locations and explicitly marked screen-effect event loop errors
are printed: the prepared data is Mojang's, and a failing assertion could quote it.
